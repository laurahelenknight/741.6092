# 741.6092 Project

This project creates a filterable gallery to visualize representation issues in design literature. It transforms library catalog records into a dataset capturing country of birth, gender, and images of designers featured in design books.

## Data Structure

The project uses a CSV file with the following columns:

- **name**: Designer's full name
- **country**: Country of birth/origin
- **region**: Geographic region (e.g., Europe, North America, Asia)
- **gender**: Designer's gender
- **image_url**: Path to the designer's image

## Features

- Filter designers by region, country, and gender
- Responsive grid layout that works on all devices
- Visual indicators for different regions
- Statistics about representation

## About the Project

This project aims to make visible some of the issues of representation in the design canon. It works with students to transform library catalog records into a dataset that captures demographic information about designers, highlighting imbalances in representation across gender, geography, and other factors.
